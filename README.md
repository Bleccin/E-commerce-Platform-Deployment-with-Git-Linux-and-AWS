I created a directory called "MarketPeak_Ecommerce"
I moved into the directory and used "git init" to initialize a local git repository.
Downloaded and extracted the E-commerce Website Template codes into the "MarketPeak_Ecommerce" directory. 
I stagged the E-commerce website codes.
I committed the codes with this commit message "Initial commit with basic e-commerce site structure"
I created a Github repository called "MarketPeak_Ecomerce" and pushed the codes from local directory into it.
